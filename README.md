**Flask Application Design for Real-time Support Operations Monitoring**

## HTML Files

- **index.html**:
  - The main HTML file that displays the real-time support operations monitoring dashboard.
  - Contains the necessary HTML elements to display charts, tables, and other visual representations of the support operations data.
  - Includes a section for displaying support tickets, their status, and relevant information.

- **login.html**:
  - Used for user authentication and login to the application.
  - Contains a form with fields for username, password, and a submit button.

- **reports.html**:
  - Displays various reports related to support operations, such as ticket resolution times, agent performance, and customer satisfaction metrics.

## Routes

- **@app.route('/')**:
  - The home route that displays the main dashboard (index.html) upon a successful login.
  - Redirects unauthenticated users to the login page.

- **@app.route('/login', methods=['GET', 'POST'])**:
  - Handles the user login process.
  - On a GET request, displays the login form (login.html).
  - On a POST request, validates the credentials entered by the user and authenticates against a database or an authentication service.

- **@app.route('/dashboard')**:
  - The main dashboard route that displays the real-time monitoring interface.
  - Displays various charts, tables, and visualizations related to the support operations data.

- **@app.route('/reports')**:
  - Displays various reports related to support operations, such as ticket resolution times, agent performance, and customer satisfaction metrics.
  - Accepts query parameters to filter and sort the data for specific time periods or criteria.

- **@app.route('/support_tickets')**:
  - Displays a list of support tickets along with their status and relevant information.
  - Supports filtering and sorting of tickets based on various criteria.

## Additional Considerations

- Use Flask's Jinja2 templating engine to dynamically render HTML pages with data from your database or other sources.
- Implement user authentication and authorization using Flask's built-in support or by integrating with a third-party authentication service.
- Employ a database like SQLite or PostgreSQL to store and manage support operations data.
- Leverage Flask's request handling capabilities to handle incoming requests and process form submissions.
- Consider using Flask-SocketIO or other real-time communication libraries to enable live updates and notifications on the dashboard.
